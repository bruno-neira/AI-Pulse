This project analyzes the key drivers behind modern AI development, focusing on compute capacity, GPU cluster growth, dataset scaling, and model complexity. By combining multiple frontier-AI datasets, it visualizes how usage, spending, hardware, and model performance have evolved over time. The goal is to highlight the underlying trends shaping the AI ecosystem and identify where compute, data, and model development may be heading next.
